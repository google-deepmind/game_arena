# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive game data storage system for the Game Arena chess tournament platform. The system will capture, store, and provide analysis capabilities for all chess games played between LLM agents, including detailed move-by-move information, player metadata, game outcomes, and performance analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tournament organizer, I want to store comprehensive game data for every chess match, so that I can analyze LLM performance and track tournament statistics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chess game is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a new game record with unique identifier, timestamp, and player information
2. WHEN a game is in progress THEN the system SHALL store each move with associated metadata including move notation, timing, and model response data
3. WHEN a game concludes THEN the system SHALL record the final outcome, game duration, and termination reason
4. IF a game is interrupted or fails THEN the system SHALL preserve all data collected up to that point with appropriate error status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access detailed move-by-move data including LLM responses and parsing information, so that I can analyze model decision-making patterns and failure modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing each move THEN the system SHALL capture the raw LLM response, parsed move, legal moves available, and any rethinking attempts
2. WHEN a move parsing fails THEN the system SHALL store the failure reason, attempted corrections, and fallback actions taken
3. WHEN using rethink sampling THEN the system SHALL store all rethink attempts with their prompts and responses
4. WHEN a move is made THEN the system SHALL store the game state before and after the move in standard notation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to query and filter game data by various criteria, so that I can perform statistical analysis and generate reports on LLM chess performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying games THEN the system SHALL support filtering by player models, date ranges, game outcomes, and tournament identifiers
2. WHEN retrieving move data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by move legality, parsing success, and move quality metrics
3. WHEN accessing game statistics THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated data on win rates, average game length, and error rates per model
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support standard formats including JSON, CSV, and PGN for chess games

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tournament administrator, I want to track player performance metrics and head-to-head statistics, so that I can rank players and organize balanced matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN games are completed THEN the system SHALL update player ELO ratings and win/loss records automatically
2. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL track metrics including illegal move rates, average thinking time, and game completion rates
3. WHEN viewing player profiles THEN the system SHALL display historical performance trends and head-to-head matchup results
4. WHEN organizing tournaments THEN the system SHALL provide player strength estimates and suggested pairings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the storage system to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle large-scale tournaments without impacting game execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing game data THEN the system SHALL not introduce more than 50ms latency to move processing
2. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain query performance through appropriate indexing and partitioning
3. WHEN concurrent games are running THEN the system SHALL handle multiple simultaneous writes without data corruption
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade by prioritizing critical game data over analytics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the storage system to integrate seamlessly with existing Game Arena components, so that minimal changes are required to current game execution logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing agents THEN the system SHALL require minimal modifications to current ChessLLMAgent and ChessRethinkAgent classes
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL work with existing tournament utilities and data structures without breaking changes
3. WHEN the storage system is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally for game execution
4. WHEN errors occur in storage THEN the system SHALL log issues but not interrupt ongoing games

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data management capabilities, so that I can maintain data integrity and system performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL support multiple backend options (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
2. WHEN data grows large THEN the system SHALL provide archiving and cleanup capabilities for old game data
3. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL support automated backup scheduling and data export functionality
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on storage performance, data quality, and system health
